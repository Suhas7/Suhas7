I'm studying Computer Engineering, Math, and Economics at The University of Texas at Austin. My current research interest is in multiagent artificial intelligence and game theory, which I recently spent a summer investigating in Dr. Katia Sycara's lab at Carnegie Mellon University. Aside from that, I enjoy developing webapps, running, piano, and animation!

- ðŸ”­  Iâ€™m working on an intelligent personal assistant & scheduler, Tascal. I'm also working on designing a nonprofit tutoring platform.
- ðŸŒ±  Iâ€™m currently learning about quantum computing, distributed systems, and combinatorial optimization.
